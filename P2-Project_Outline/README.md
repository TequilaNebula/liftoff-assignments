### Overview
As a streamer and I want to create an application where streamers can evaluate the games they play on stream to help them get a better understanding of what their community likes and help the community see what the streamer likes.

To do this the streamer can go to the application after stream and take a short 5 question survey about the game they just played. This can help other streamers by letting them see how certain games did on stream.
